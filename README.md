## Documentation

In short, there isn't any - nor are there any plans to create any. The `/examples` directory
contains many examples and should provide a nice start for you. Otherwise, the [tutorial for
rbcurse](https://github.com/rkumar/rbcurse-tutorial) is still mostly valid for the majority of this
codebase. 

## rbcurse

This project is a continuation/fork of [rkumar](https://github.com/rkumar)'s [rbcurse](https://github.com/rkumar/rbcurse-core). 
rbcurse is no longer maintained as of March 2014.
